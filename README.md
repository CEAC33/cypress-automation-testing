**What is Cypress?**

Â· Cypress is a next generation front end Automation testing tool built for the modern web applications

**How Cypress is Unique from other Automation tools?**

Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.

Ability to test Edge Testcases by Mocking the server response

Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. We can hover over each commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.

Because of its Architectural design, Cypress delivers fast, consistent and reliable test execution compared to other Automation tools

View videos of your entire tests execution when run from the Cypress Dashboard.

*******************************************************************************************

Cypress built on Node.js and comes packaged as an npm module,

As it is built on Node.js, It uses JavaScript for writing tests. But 90% of coding can be done using Cypress inbuilt commands which are easy to understand.

Cypress also bundles with jQuery and inherits many of jQuery methods for UI components Identification

**Cypress Architecture**

Most testing tools (like Selenium) operate by running outside of the browser and executing remote commands across the network. But Cypress engine directly operates inside the browser. In other words, It is the browser that is executing your test code

This enables Cypress to listen and modify the browser behavior at run time by manipulating DOM and altering Network requests and responses on the fly

Cypress open doors to New Kind of testing with Having ultimate control over your application (front and back)

## Cypress Test Runner & Command Line Features

```
node_modules\.bin\cypress open
```

### Build Cypress Basic test and run from Test Runner

https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html

> Delete all files inside `cypress/integration/examples` folder

> Create a file `Test1.js` inside `cypress/integration/examples` folder

```js
describe('My First Test Suite', function() 
{
 
it('My FirstTest case', function() 
{

//test step

})

it('My Second case', function() 
{

//test step

})

})
```

Test1.js
```js
describe('My First Test Suite', function() 
{
 
it('My FirstTest case', function() 
{

cy.visit("https://www.bootcamps.online/")

})

})
```

### Running Cypress Tests in supported browsers

- Chrome
- Electron
- Canary
- Chromium

https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#Installation

Running all tests from the terminal:

```
./node_modules/.bin/cypress run
```

Running specific spec from the terminal:

```
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/my-spec.js"
```

If you run Cypress from command line, Cypress runs in headless and in Electron browser 

Running all tests from the terminal opening the browser:

```
./node_modules/.bin/cypress run --headed
```

https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers.html

Running all tests from the terminal opening the browser in Chrome:

```
./node_modules/.bin/cypress run --headed --browser chrome
```
